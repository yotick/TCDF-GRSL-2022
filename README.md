        abstract = {Pansharpening aims at fusing a multispectral ({MS}) image and panchromatic ({PAN}) image to obtain a high spatial resolution multispectral ({HRMS}) image. To obtain accurate details and reduce spectral distortion, this letter proposes an efﬁcient pansharpening approach based on texture correction ({TC}) and detail reﬁnement. First, a {TC} model is constructed based on spatial and spectral ﬁdelity constraints to obtain a texture image that is highly correlated with the {MS} image. Second, a detail acquisition model is proposed by the consecutive parameter regression to adaptively reﬁne the extracted details. Finally, the extracted details are injected into the up-sampled {MS} ({UPMS}) image to obtain the fused {HRMS} image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain the highquality results with high efﬁciency.},
